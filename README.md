# Final Project — Foundation Models Code-Along

This is the completed project from the *Meet with Apple* session: **“Code along with the Foundation Models framework.”**

> **Note:** These instructions and the sample code are tied to the event *Meet with Apple: Code along with the Foundation Models framework.*

## About this project
In this code-along, I gained hands-on experience using the Foundation Models framework to integrate Apple’s on-device LLM into an app. I built generative AI features directly in Xcode, exploring capabilities such as:
- Text generation  
- Structured data output (guided generation)  
- Response streaming to dynamically update the UI  
- Tool calling to fetch data or perform actions  

## How to use this repository
- Open the project in **Xcode 26**  
- Build and run to explore the final implementation  
- Review the **SwiftUI views** and **view models** to see how I integrated the Foundation Models APIs  

## How I used this project with the guide
This project was developed alongside the live demo. Each chapter of the guide included:
- **Playground snippets** for isolated experimentation  
- **App steps** to evolve the starter project in Xcode  
- **Model definitions** for custom types and tools  

During the session, I first used the Playground snippets to explore the APIs, then implemented the App steps to bring those features into the SwiftUI views and view models.  
This repository represents the final result of that integration.  

## Requirements
- A Mac with **Apple silicon** that supports Apple Intelligence  
- The latest version of **macOS Tahoe 26**  
- **Xcode 26**  

## Language
The session was conducted in **English**.
